# About me

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) on Mixed Reality (AR/VR) tech. My team focuses on research and development of [eye tracking and iris recognition](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/design/eye-tracking) algorithms for mixed reality devices (checkout [Hololens 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens)). Prior to this, I worked with the [Prime Video](https://www.primevideo.com/) tech at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) creating a refreshed experience for the [200+ million users](https://techjury.net/blog/amazon-prime-statistics/) (as of Jan' 23).

From 2019 to 2021, I completed my [Masters degree in Computer Science](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) from [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). I focused heavily on ML research in Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning and Information Retrieval. I also worked at Prime Video, Amazon building the page for new and upcoming content on Prime Video over the summer of 2020.

Before coming to the States, I completed my undergraduate degree from [National Institute of Technology, Surat (SVNIT)](https://www.svnit.ac.in/web/department/computer/). I joined [Directi](https://www.directi.com/) (later EIG India) in 2016 after graduation for my first job as a Software Engineer building scalable micro-services services. I also worked in their products lab. Later I joined [Gojek](https://www.gojek.io/), an Indonesian ride-hailing unicorn startup and worked on their e-wallet product and also helped build their central OpenID and OAuth 2.0 compliant auth platform.
