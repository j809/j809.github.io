# About me

I build distributed systems and next-gen tech.

I am a Software Engineer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) where I work on cutting-edge Mixed Reality (AR/VR) tech. My team focuses on R&D for [eye tracking and iris recognition](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/design/eye-tracking) algorithms for mixed reality devices (checkout [Hololens 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens)). Prior to this, I worked at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) as part of one of the world's most loved streaming platforms, [Prime Video](https://www.primevideo.com/). As a part of the team, I engineered and launched a refreshed experience for the [200+ million users](https://techjury.net/blog/amazon-prime-statistics/) (as of Jan' 23) of the platform, which led to [Prime Video overtaking Netflix](https://in.ign.com/tech/177063/news/amazon-prime-video-overtakes-netflix-as-the-biggest-streaming-service-in-the-us) as the biggest streaming service in the US.

I completed my [Master's degree in Computer Science](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) from [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) in 2021. I focused heavily on ML research in Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning and Information Retrieval. I also worked at Prime Video building the "Coming Soon" page for new and upcoming content from scratch over the summer of 2020.

Before coming to the States, I completed my undergraduate degree from [National Institute of Technology, Surat (SVNIT)](https://www.svnit.ac.in/web/department/computer/). For my first job, I joined [Directi](https://www.directi.com/) (later EIG India) in 2016 after graduation and worked in their product labs to build products and scalable micro-services in their web presence business. Later I joined [Gojek](https://www.gojek.io/), an Indonesian ride-hailing unicorn startup and worked on their e-wallet product and also helped build their central OpenID and OAuth 2.0 compliant auth platform.
